1) Explain what is the difference between a null string and an empty string?
	- The null string does not have a value and the string exists in memory, but no elements are assigned. An empty string, 
              on the other hand, is assigned an element that is an empty value such as '\0'. 

2) Your class declares two member functions named set(...).  In C, this would generate an error.  Name the feature of C++ that allows this.
	- The feature of C++ has function overloading. The C++ compiler can distinguish through the parameter list even though functions 
               have same identifiers. Therefore, even if you declare multiple functions with the same name, invoking the function does not 
               produce an error if the parameters are different.

3) For the at-home portion you had to change the logic that validates a SIN. How would you design your class in such a way that if a new 
   update to the validation logic is necessary, you don't have to change anything in the func-tion CRA_Account::set(...)?
	- If I need to update a new validation logic without changing the function CRA_Account::set(...), I will be able to define a new overloading 
              member function(set()) for updating validate SIN number in the class. then I will change the function CRA_Account::isEmpty() instead of 
              the function CRA_Account::set(...). And CRA_Account::isEmpty() can get the value when the logic of both the new function and 
              CRA_Account::set(...) is satisfied.

4) What have you learned in completing this workshop?
	- Through this workshop, I have learned how to use Class. I have studied that Private values in Class could only be dealt with through
               the membership function. Through function overload, I have learned how to deal with the same name function separately through
               parameter. The most difficult thing was to find the validate SIN number logic and I was finally able to make the code simple using 
               'for' iteration. Lastly I have learned how to do formatting balance value using 'setf()' and 'precision()'when I print out. 

Quiz 2 Reflection
1. What are the tree classes of member functions for a structure?
 	- Queries , Modifiers, Special 
	- I was confused 'privacy' , ' public'. I wrote privacy and public.
