The purpose of using namespace is to prevent problem in a project where multiple people use the same identifier.
We develop applications within the scope by specifying the scope of our own namespace for each of us to develop.
The purpose of use of the header file can be saved by dividing the prototype of the function into a header file and 
calling the header file from the main function. In this way, the desired function can be retrieved through the header
file whenever necessary and the code of the main function can not be seen as complex, making it more code-readable.

The header file contains only the declaration of the interface between the program's source file (.cpp) and .h. The source
file(.cpp) will be a compilation and the header file will act as a bridge to connect with each other when compiles multiple 
source files.

The reason why a .cpp file does not need to be included in another .cpp file is that the .cpp file contains the implementation
 of programs and functions. Therefore, it is sufficient to connect between main files through the header file, which refers to 
the implementation file in question.

Through this workshop, I learned how to use safeguard and namespace. When I used the namespace, I had difficulties. I was 
not used to it yet, so it was difficult to make good use of it. And to use the namespace of the same name through a header
file, we learned to enclose both prototypes and functions in the namespace, and it was also new to divide namespace of the 
same name into one. As I have learned so far, I have many difficulties because there are many differencesfrom the C program. 
I felt that I need more practice and study to keep up with the course.
