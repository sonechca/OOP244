1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
- The Abstract Base Class contains at least one pure virtual function. it usually exists such as the 
base class in a hierarchy and does not provide any implementation so we cannot make objects 
of this class, while the concrete class derives from the abstract base class and give implementation 
to pure virtual function.

2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?
- Account::credit(amount)
- Account::debit(c_trans)

3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
- I have learned pure virtual function with abstract base class and by using allocator.cpp, I could 
choose derived object through getting input such as ‘S’, ‘C’.
