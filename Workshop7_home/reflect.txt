1. Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class? (Hint: search for "SuperHero" in Hero.cpp)
- Because Hero class is a parent class and will not use SuperHero class, it doesn't need to know the inherited SuperHero class.

2. Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? (Hint: search for "Hero" in SuperHero.cpp)
 - The superhero class can be used by invoking the Hero's Data Member and Member functions because it inherited from Hero class 
that is parents class. To do that, the superhero class needs to know the Hero class.

3. The program prints out "Ancient Battle!" when two Heroes fight. It prints out "Super Fight!" when two SuperHeroes fight. When 
you made a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?
- It will print out the "Ancient Battle!". Because the * operator of the inherited superhero class has parameters that receive two 
superhero objects. However, the * operator of Hero class which is parents class can receive objects from inherited superheroes as 
parameters. so the program will use Hero's * operator.

4. True or False: is the following definition for main valid? Explain.
int main() {
  Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5);
}
- True, both Hero's object create each hero object using constructor and * operator will work because both objects are satisfied 
with the parameter conditions of the operator.

5. True or False: is the following definition for main valid? Explain.
int main() {
 (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5)) 
                          *
 (Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2));
}
- True, Because the * operator operates in parentheses and returns the Hero object as the result value, the code will activate 
the * operator anew with the result value of two objects.
